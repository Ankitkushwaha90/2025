## 1. Understanding Bug Bounty Programs

### Scope and Rules
Before starting, carefully review the scope of the program. This includes:
- Allowed domains, subdomains, and applications.
- Specific exclusions (e.g., third-party services or internal networks).
- Rules of engagement (e.g., no DDoS or social engineering).

### Reading Program Policies
Understand:
- Reward structures.
- Response time.
- Expected formats for reports.

## 2. Advanced Reconnaissance

### Subdomain Enumeration
Use tools like `Subfinder`, `Amass`, and `Assetfinder` to find subdomains. Combine the results and validate using `Httpx`.

```bash
subfinder -d example.com | httpx -silent
```

### Asset Discovery
Scan for hidden directories and endpoints:
- Use tools like `FFUF` or `Dirbuster` with custom wordlists.

### Third-party and Forgotten Assets
Identify assets hosted on forgotten servers or third-party services using `crt.sh`, `Wayback Machine`, and similar tools.

## 3. Exploiting Web Applications

### Advanced SQL Injection Techniques
1. Test for Blind SQLi using conditional responses or time delays.
2. Use tools like `sqlmap` but validate manually to avoid false positives.

Example:
```sql
?id=1' AND SLEEP(5)--
```

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Test internal services by leveraging SSRF:
- Identify file://, gopher://, or other non-HTTP protocols.
- Use cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Depth

1. **DOM-based XSS**: Look for insecure JavaScript handling user inputs.
2. **Stored XSS**: Find persistent injections that impact other users.
3. **Bypassing Filters**: Use advanced payload encoding techniques.

Payload Example:
```html
<svg/onload=fetch('https://attacker.com')>
```

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Identify endpoints that process user inputs without sanitization:
- Test file uploads with malicious payloads.
- Use parameter tampering to inject commands.

## 4. Network-based Vulnerabilities

### Identifying Open Ports and Services
Use tools like `Nmap` and `Masscan` to map services and ports:

```bash
nmap -sV -p- example.com
```

### Exploiting Misconfigured Network Protocols
- Test for default credentials on services like FTP, SMB, and SNMP.
- Exploit vulnerabilities in outdated versions of services (e.g., Heartbleed).

## 5. Mobile Application Security

### Reverse Engineering APKs
Decompile APKs using `APKTool` to analyze code and extract endpoints.

```bash
apktool d app.apk
```

### Testing APIs and Endpoints
- Capture and analyze API traffic using `Burp Suite` or `Postman`.
- Look for insecure API methods (e.g., `GET` requests handling sensitive data).

### Identifying Local Storage Vulnerabilities
Inspect local storage for sensitive information:
- Check SQLite databases, shared preferences, and local files.

## 6. Automating the Hunt

### Tools and Scripts
- **Burp Suite**: For web vulnerability scanning.
- **ReconFTW**: For automated reconnaissance.
- **Nuclei**: For vulnerability template scanning.

### Custom Wordlists
Create targeted wordlists based on technology stacks:
- Use `CeWL` to generate lists from websites.
- Include parameters, common directory names, etc.

## 7. Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Writing Clear and Impactful Reports
- Clearly describe the vulnerability and its impact.
- Provide steps to reproduce and evidence (screenshots, logs).

### Providing Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
- Include working PoCs whenever possible.
- Example for XSS PoC:

```html
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```
